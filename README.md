# VTH_WS
Arduino beginner material used in a workshop @ Science Center in Lund 2017.

Workshop_2_SerialMonitor.ino is suitable to go through and solve together. Some parts are harder and it's recommended 
to modify code for ones needs.

WS_2_exercises.ino is suitable to do by oneself or in small groups once the exercise above is completed.

Harder_exercise_WS_2.ino is a more difficult exercise for those who know Arduino/code logic well.
